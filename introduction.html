                          At Maxfort, we believe in excellence and inspire our children to achieve the highest with
                          enthusiasm, excitement and enduring efforts.
                          We prepare them to go beyond expectations by becoming persistent learners, independent,
                          reliable, efficient decision makers with a progressive approach. Our broad curriculum ensures
                          that students are not just well equipped for examinations but are ready for the world, work
                          and life.

                          School Life at Maxfort provides students an exclusive experience that is based on an all

                          environment for them to grow and develop. A nurturing, cohesive and culture of acceptance
                          ensures that students can learn to evolve their personality and explore their own identity as
                          they build relations, while attending school. Apart from academics, Maxfort is always teeming
                          with miscellaneous activities that groom children, help to develop their personalities going
                          beyond just relaxation or breaking routines. Enriching students in all dimensions, these
                          activities provide a fulfilling experience that stays with the students for the rest of their
                          lives.

                          The Pre-Primary years are the most crucial years in the life of a child since it is in this
                          time that the child develops psychologically and studies indicate that nearly two-thirds of
                          the child's intellectual abilities develop at this stage. The children develop their emotional
                          and social temperaments as well as other core aspects of their personality during this time
                          period only.

                          We, at Maxfort, understand this. Hence, we provide a stimulating environment that is not only
                          in accordance to the age and mental development of your child but is also thought provoking
                          and suitably challenging to help him/her develop to his/her full potential.

                          The environment at Maxfort is totally safe and secure with excitement and fun added to help
                          children make the transition from home to school smoothly.
                          The school life in the Pre-Primary stage is balanced with numerous activities that focus on
                          physical, emotional, social, intellectual and spiritual development of the child. Our highly
                          trained faculty guides the children through various activities encouraging them to play and
                          learn in groups as well as individually to pace all round development.
                          During this time, focus is laid on environmental, physical and technological education along
                          with music and arts. Besides this, language, perception, critical thinking, communication,
                          creativity and collaboration skills are also inculcated.

                          Offering a strong academic and intellectual foundation, Maxfort Pre-Primary Life prepares your
                          child fundamentally for the future.

                          children to bring out the best in them in terms of educational outcome. The ever engaging
                          curriculum is brought to life by the dynamic teachers who encourage the children to enquire,
                          question and think.

                          With a focus on preparing students for future challenges, We guide children to develop a
                          passion for lifelong learning. Numerous activities like projects, assembly presentations, role
                          play and group discussions are incorporated into the curriculum to engage students at all
                          stages. As they develop through various levels of growth, we help them to structure their work
                          without losing the element of fun and excitement.
                          <i> A thorough planning of the class room environment makes it a point that hands- on-

                          focus on their individual capacity and abilities. Excellent performance is appreciated and
                          celebrated with awards and accolades

                          their social, physical, emotional as well as academic and cognitive development. Each child is
                          fostered to be independent and self-motivated.
                          The faculty works in tandem with the parents, acknowledging and observing every detail of
                          their growth, giving feedback and planning future work for every child. This helps in the all
                          round growth of the child throughout the primary years.

                          Numerous cultural activities enrich the students and help them develop a wider and deeper
                          perspective of life.

                          endeavors to promote an able and diverse student body. It encourages in each member the traits
                          of curiosity, creativity, leadership, flexibility, intellectual risk taking, independence of
                          thought and respect for scholarship.

                          Through a balanced mix of scholastic and co scholastic activities, it seeks to build a more
                          egalitarian basis for social and personal growth. Children's freedom and space is respected to
                          enable them to blossom into well groomed individuals. The school encourages them to develop a
                          winning attitude that determines the quality of motivation and strength of commitment.

                          interaction. It also develops within students a will to face challenges in both work and play
                          as also a sense of competence, self-confidence and emotional and physical well-being. Children
                          are taught to appreciate the dignity of human labour. Sports and other co-curricular
                          activities remain an integral part of the curriculum.


                          A stress free, non-coercive and creative environment both within and outside the class enables
                          the children to hone their skills and unfurl their innovativeness. The school also provides
                          them with an opportunity for developing a strong bond of faith and mutual respect with their
                          peers, teachers and parents.


                          The focus is on making them good human beings who are morally upright and grounded. They are
                          taught that "Success is nothing but getting up each time you fall". Minds are fine tuned to
                          accept failure as a part of learning.

                        <h2>Secondary & Sr. Secondary</h2>
                        <p>

                          In our senior wing, our vision is to prepare our students for life, outside the portals of the
                          formal Institution. We broaden their horizons so that their world encompasses the whole
                          mankind.

                          We wish to deepen their thoughts, so that their learning becomes the means to achieve that
                          perfection of mind in which analytical reasoning goes hand in hand with logical conclusion.


                          We also wish earnestly to instill them in basic core values of living a good and a happy life
                          like honesty, goodness, humility, philanthropy with frequent counseling we ensure that they
                          become more adaptive and accept changes with ease. Nothing is constant in this life. Once they
                          learn to accept things, they eventually become more contented. They will be guided to accept
                          adversities without fear. Gender equality is another important trait that will be sensitized
                          to. Every Maxfortian has to learn to treat every individual with respect, without any
                          discrimination.


                          At the academic front, we strive to provide pedagogies that will promote learning of Science
                          and Technology. The focus will also be on liberal arts and language learning, purely based on
                          the interest and the aptitude of our learners. Efforts are to create a healthy learning
                          environment, treating mental agility and physical fitness as a priority by weaving this fabric
                          in the curriculum.


                          In the senior wing, our young adults are made responsible for those who are less fortunate, by
                          involving them in various community services. Also they are trained to respect all incumbents,
                          by fully comprehending the right to privacy.

                          We strive hard to provide a 'Child Safe' environment and we are in it together as a team. Our
                          prime focus is on providing them with a basket of skills.
