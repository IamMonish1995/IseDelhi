                            progressive curriculum
                          </h2>
                          <p>
                            It is rightly said that knowing what you want is the
                            first step toward getting it. If you have goals
                            you'd like to pursue, try writing them in a Goals
                            journal. In what you want to accomplish and then
                            follow it aggressively. By writing what you want,
                            you will surely realize that it's a helpful way to
                            measure your progress, anticipate buffers, and stay
                            inspired. At Ise Delhi, we have a sure way of
                            knowing what we want, and then to achieve the same,
                            how do we proceed?

                          <h2>Social and Mental Wellbeing</h2>
                          <p>
                            We weave into the fabric of our curriculum,
                            activities that ensure the social and mental
                            well-being of every Ise Delhi under our care. The
                            famous Psychologist, Sigmund Freud rightly advocated
                            the formative years as the most crucial years of any
                            kind of learning. Children are like clay and every
                            learning experience has an imprint on their minds.
                            Therefore, Empowering Curriculum lays a lot of
                            emphasis on experiential learning. Through various
                            wellconceived and well-spread activities, we ensure
                            young children acquire the social skills of
                            adaptation, working in a team and understanding the
                            importance of respecting and listening to others'
                            views in a team. These basic skills go a long way in
                            nurturing them towards a more acceptable adult in
                            their later years.

                          <p>
                            We ensure and encourage critical thinking in Ise
                            Delhiians. The concepts are put across in such a
                            manner, where inputs are elicited from the young
                            minds, discussion is always a hallmark of our
                            classroom environment, which enables our children to
                            think critically by wearing their 'Thinking Caps'.
                            Sans values, no education is complete. Also, this
                            encourages them to come up with their ideas and
                            gives them the freedom to explore. We do not focus
                            only on our children acquiring literary
                            qualifications, but prepare them to be lifelong
                            learners, which is the main and the real purpose of
                            education.

                            adopting the modern approach, we keep them grounded,
                            and ensure that they are abreast with the
                            traditional methods. The rich cultural heritage is
                            our wealth. Children are familiarized with the same
                            through contextual teaching & learning. We lay a lot
                            of emphasis on building a relationship and
                            fine-tuning our young minds in accordance. We at Ise

                            market. It is estimated that in the next decade, the
                            job market will go for a complete overhauling and
                            simultaneously, the basket of skills required for
                            being employable, too, will change. Future
                            generations will need coding, data analysis, and
                            entrepreneurial skills to name a few. Ise Delhi is a
                            platform, where we'll strive to give them exposure,
                            to all of this by collaborating with all the
                            stakeholders from time to time.

                          <p>
                            Besides these technical skills, we lay a lot of
                            emphasis on the basic attributes like gratitude,
                            decision making, emotional literacy, learning to
                            apologize easily, ability to resolve conflict,
                            empathy and compassion, developing mindful eating
                            habits etc. all these objectives are weaved
                            carefully in our curriculum so that children learn
                            these automatically without much effort. Our faculty
                            is not only highly qualified but also empowered and
                            enriched from time to time to handle it with ease.
                            Their continuous professional development is a major
                            and essential component of this institution. We
                            highly recommend they stay abreast with the latest
                            pedagogies. This is achieved through several
                            academic workshops, which they attend throughout the
                            academic year. A lot of focus is laid on subject
                            efficiency, we at Ise Delhi build perspective
                            thinking minds, and we empower life on our campus,
                            through our well-designed curriculum, which offers
                            comprehensive standards, aligned social and
                            emotional learning (SEL) in addition to our CPD
                            programme. All of these are integrated into our
                            academic programmes across classes. We follow
                            pedagogies, which encourage students to think about
                            "Real Issues". We empower them through several
                            planned activities and programmes where they develop
                            the skill of taking decisions and this skill of
                            decision making goes a long way for the rest of
                            their life, both on the professional as well as
                            personal front. We at Ise Delhi follow a combination
                            of both traditional methods of teaching and modern
                            methods of teaching because the amalgamation of both
                            forms of teaching will be beneficial for our Ise
                            Delhi. In the Traditional Teaching Method, the
                            teachers explain the concept to the learners with
                            the use of a blackboard and chalk and ask the
                            students to note down in their notebooks and
                            memorize and recite the notes. On the other hand,
                            Modern Methods of Teaching are a student-based and
                            dedicated to more practical approaches.

                          <h2>Modern Teaching Methods</h2>
                          <p>
                            The teaching method focuses more on teaching the
                            students for improving their intellect behaviour by
                            using various new and innovative ideas rather than
                            making them rote memorise the concepts to clear the
                            examination. This new teaching method which we call
                            the modern teaching method is more activity-based
                            and centres around the learner's mind, keeping the
                            learners as the primary target.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            In this way, learners actively participate in the
                            whole process to build their knowledge and sharpen
                            their skills, this is also termed as "Constructive
                            Approach". The need of the hour for students is to
                            embrace the contemporary teaching methods which will
                            also help in reducing the competition among the
                            students, promote cooperation, and boost a healthy
                            study environment. We focus more on modern teaching
                            methods and include the following elements in our
                            system:

                            The learning process involves learners and the focus
                            is on learning that happens in the classroom. The
                            facilitators are only there to guide the learners.
                            The learners are motivated to bring their knowledge,
                            past experiences and ideas which help them develop
                            skills such as teamwork, problem-solving and
                            decision making.

                          <p>
                            Activity-based learning is the process of learning
                            by doing. The activities play a key role in
                            learning. The teacher organizes activities or tasks
                            and engages students to learn through interactive
                            activities like picture reading, storyboarding,
                            puzzles and games. Moreover, Ise Delhi employs the
                            use of smart technology such as interactive boards
                            and VR headsets to make learning fun and engaging.

                          <p>
                            Our teaching-learning process is based on the rich
                            resources that the teacher organizes before
                            introducing the topics in the classroom. Several
                            important resource sites, such as YouTube channels,
                            and helpful websites are conveyed to the learners
                            and they are assigned a task to go home and get into

                            sites and coming to the class prepared with the
                            information and understanding of the topic. Then in
                            the classroom, the teacher initiates a discussion,
                            where all students are encouraged to participate by
                            giving their inputs, interacting with peers and
                            unanimously, the class arrives at certain
                            generalizations which are noted by all in their
                            notebooks. Based on this interactive discussion the
                            facilitator raises certain high order thinking
                            questions (HOTS), the parable answers to which are
                            discussed in the class. The students are encouraged
                            to ink this information in their own words.

                            group of students where they can solve their
                            problems, debate on different topics and clear their
                            queries. This not only helps in developing social
                            skills but also allows students to understand the
                            subject faster. The kids learn to tolerate others,
                            develop skills to listen to others and how to work
                            in a team. They will be able to meet different
                            personalities and can get a genuine review of their
                            work.

                          <h2>GAMIFICATION</h2>
                          <p>
                            As the very word denotes the concept building
                            especially in the elementary stage is put across to
                            the young learners by introducing several games,
                            experiments which could be in the form of puzzles,
                            solving riddles etc. the class is divided into
                            smaller groups and each group has a team leader. The
                            instructions are given by the teachers in their
                            classrooms and the rules are explained. All groups
                            initiate, following the rules and are encouraged
                            throughout, before they arrive at desired
                            conclusions. The team leader discusses the outcome
                            in the class and if required corrective measures are
                            discussed mutually in the classroom itself. Through
                            this, we encourage team-building skills and the
                            skill of adaptation and adjustment where each
                            learner learns to respect the views of fellow
                            members of the group. Based on the conclusion of
                            these activities, the teacher then introduces the
                            concept with an objective, that each learner relates
                            to it based on his or her experiential learning.
                            Learning through gamification has shown tremendous
                            positive outcomes, especially in the foundation
                            years.

                          <h2>SPACED LEARNING</h2>
                          <p>
                            The attention span in young children is very less.
                            So, it is here in this age group that, Spaced
                            learning teaching method is used. It reduces the
                            cognitive burnout of the children, and instead, it
                            makes learning more effective and long-lasting. The
                            gap is meant to refresh the mind of the learners and
                            to make them prepare for the next part of the same
                            lesson. This method gives the students intervals to
                            inherit the knowledge and creates connections
                            between learnings.

                          <p>
                            Curiosity pushes the learner to learn new and more
                            and more always. Teaching students to operate the
                            internet and find results themselves, helps them to
                            be self-dependent and gives them a deep
                            understanding of the content. Our teachers allow the
                            students to bring in new ideas and work on them for
                            the development of their brain and ability to work
                            alone and to give them the feel of decision making.
